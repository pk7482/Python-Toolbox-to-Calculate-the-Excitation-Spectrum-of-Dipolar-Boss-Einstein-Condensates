# Python-Toolbox-to-Calculate-the-Excitation-Spectrum-of-Dipolar-Boss-Einstein-Condensates
The toolbox is designed for ease of use with minimal dependencies. Users can define system parameters such as dipolar interaction strength, trapping potential, and condensate density profile to compute the excitation spectrum efficiently.
